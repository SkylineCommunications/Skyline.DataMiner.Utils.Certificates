# Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.Certificates

## About

Certificates class library that helps to manage X509Certificates. We expect that every certificate is stored in a folder containing a .crt file and a .p12 file.

## Usage

This library can be used to manage the certificate files that are created through the [certificate manager automation script](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/SLC-AS-ManageCertificates).

# Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.Certificates

## About

Certificates class library that can be used to extract basic details about X509Certificate format certificates. 

## Usage

The certificate is created by specifying the public key path (.crt file) and the private key path (.p12 file).
Methods are then available to extract information about the certificate, such as the issuing authority and distinguished name.

Can be used in conjunction with the [certificate manager automation script](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/SLC-AS-ManageCertificates).
